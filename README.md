"Cute or the Boot?"
Vote for your favourite Australian animal

Koala, Wombat, Echidna or the Tawny Frogmouth?

What is the the most popular animal in Australia?

This Govhack 2015 hopes to find out!




- Utilises the Atlas of Living Australia database API

- Sort of like Hot or Not but for Australian Animals (but not as creepy)

- Fun and colourful voting interface. Animations in Javascript.

- The page visitor is offered the choice between randomly presented two animals, and then votes for their favourite of the two,
The user is then offered another option, and we build up a database of user responses.

- We show a photo and some educational facts for each animal. (Name, Scientific Name, Region, Endangered status)

- on the bottom, we provide a tab that shows a league table of the most popular animals so far.

- We can pull the list of all the animals from http://api.ala.org.au/# to use as the database of our choices.

- We then feed the photos we need into the page via the API.

- include buttons for posting your votes to social media
